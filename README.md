# Shadow DOM Custom Element Injection

### The important file here is injector.js

---

### How it works:
1. User creates an HTML <template> and pastes it into injector.js
1. User creates a class for the template
1. Any HTML page with injector.js attached to it can utilize and reuse the custom elements via Shadow DOM
