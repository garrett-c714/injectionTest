<!-- Ideally, including <test-template></test-template> in this doc
would create an element based on the template, but the constructor 
returns null because the templates.html document isn't loaded or 
"in focus" when we are on the home page, theres no way for it to
select the template. This seems like some kind of thinking problem,
and I believe theres an easy way to do this, but I can't come
up with it.-->
